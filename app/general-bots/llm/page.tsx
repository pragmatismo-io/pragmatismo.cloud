            # LLM

LLMs power a wide variety of natural language processing tasks, allowing you to 'talk to' your data. Visit the app gallery below to see the thousands of use cases, including:

Content generation
Language translation
Chatbots and virtual assistants
Data analysis and insights
Content summarization

# Main Providers

OpenAI has become the standard for LLM apps due to its pioneering GPT research, high-quality outputs, steerability, and accessible API. Their first-mover debut of ChatGPT and large transformer models sparked the imagination of developers, and the world, at large.

General Bots is an orchestration frameworks with agents and tools designed to augment LLM capabilities. Agents can be combined to manage and optimize LLM functions, such as refining AI reasoning, addressing biases, and integrating external data sources.

# General Bots

Bots let users iteratively refine answers, leaving room for fluid, human-like conversations with the LLM. Conversely, 69% of LLM apps use text inputs with a single objective, generally not allowing for conversational refinement.

In an effort to minimize hallucination and build trust in generated responses, LLM orchestration frameworks facilitate retrieval augmented generation, as well as the ability to test and evaluate LLM models.

## Large Language Models
Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep learning AI algorithms designed to understand and generate human-like text for a variety of practical purposes.

LLMs are pre-trained by processing natural language patterns from vast text datasets. Fine-tuning refines a pre-trained model to adapt to specific tasks by training it on specialized data.

The most popular use cases for LLMs include content generation or summarization, language translation, chatbots/virtual assistants, or insights from data analysis.

## LLM Orchestration
LLMs rely on the data they're trained on, which can come with limitations, biases, and may be incomplete.

Orchestration frameworks, like LangChain or LlamaIndex, allow developers to enhance their LLM and accomplish more, through AI agents and tools. This control layer helps improve the reliability, scalability, and accuracy of the responses generated.

This unlocks the potential for LLMs to reveal their reasoning, continually “self-ask” the LLM to gather more relevant information for the task, make external API calls to other data sources, and much more.

## Vector Retrieval
Vector retrieval tools enable fast, efficient search from unstructured datasets (including text, images, video, or audio). These tools are commonly used in search or recommendation engines.

Vector search tools (e.g. FAISS or Elasticsearch) transform unstructured datasets into numerical representations so the algorithm can locate similar data.
Vector databases (e.g. Pinecone or Chroma) use indexing and other techniques to speed up the retrieval process.
Visual UI
Streamlit's free, open-source Python library enables data scientists and developers to easily create interactive web apps with a user-friendly visual UI for data exploration and visualization.
